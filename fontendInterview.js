Basic Front-End Developer Questions:

What is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers that store and deliver web content, such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript, to users based on their geographical location. CDNs help improve website performance by reducing latency and distributing the load.

What is AJAX?

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques used to create asynchronous requests to a server from a web page. It allows for dynamic content loading without requiring a full page reload.

What are the differences between HTML and XHTML?

HTML is more forgiving of errors, while XHTML is stricter and requires well-formed XML syntax. XHTML also enforces lowercase tag names, uses self-closing tags, and requires properly nested elements.

What is responsive design?

Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures a website's layout and content adapt fluidly to various screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Q - What are the different types of CSS selectors?
Ans -  CSS selectors are used to select and style HTML elements. Common types include:
Type selectors (e.g., p for paragraphs).
Class selectors (e.g., .my-class).
ID selectors (e.g., #my-id).
Descendant selectors (e.g., div p).
Child selectors (e.g., ul > li).
Pseudo-class selectors (e.g., :hover).

What is a pseudo-class?
A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector to specify a special state or behavior of an element. For example, :hover is a pseudo-class used to apply styles when the mouse pointer is over an element.

What is a CSS reset?

A CSS reset is a set of styles that standardizes default styles across different web browsers. It helps developers start with a consistent baseline and avoid browser-specific quirks.

What is a CSS grid system?

A CSS grid system is a layout system that uses grids (rows and columns) to organize and align elements on a web page. It provides a structured way to create responsive layouts.

What is a CSS preprocessor?

A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends the capabilities of CSS. Examples include Sass, Less, and Stylus. Preprocessors introduce variables, functions, and nesting, making CSS code more maintainable and efficient.

What are the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor?

Benefits of using a CSS preprocessor include code reusability, variable management, nesting for cleaner code, and the ability to create modular and maintainable stylesheets.

What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework developed by Twitter. It provides a set of pre-designed, responsive UI components and a grid system to help streamline and accelerate web development.

What are the benefits of using Bootstrap?

Benefits of using Bootstrap include faster development, consistent styling, responsive design out-of-the-box, and a large community with extensive documentation and support.

What is a task runner?

A task runner is a tool or software that automates repetitive tasks in the front-end development workflow, such as minification, compilation, and deployment. Examples include Grunt, Gulp, and npm scripts.

What are the benefits of using a task runner?

Task runners improve development efficiency by automating tasks, ensuring code consistency, and enabling easy integration of plugins for various build processes.

What made you become a front-end developer?
